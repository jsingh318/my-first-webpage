<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>Personal</h2>
 <p>As my personal circumstances in life have been changing, it is becoming clear to me that this
 is the right time for me to go ahead with the career change that I have always wanted. 
 Information Technology had always been sector where I wanted to end up. Being tech savvy
  in my previous work environments was always the in thing. The working behind the 
  websites be it commercial or otherwise has always been intriguing. <br>Hence, started the quest for learning how to Code.</p>
<p>The Learning</p>
<p>Learning Code seems to be everywhere, this realisation dawned soon after, I have started 
screening through loads of readily available study material online. Dozens of free 
websites and learning courses and sources but no direction to the path of complete 
enlightenment...errrr I meant Codenment.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am <strong>passionate</strong> about what I do and give my 100%. When I undertake a 
project or task, I go the extra mile and try to make it better than requested. 
Driven Professional with broad technical skill set. Excellent communicator experienced 
in interpreting and implementing client and staff visions of new website. Known for ability 
to multi-task and juggle multiple pressing projects simultaneously, meeting all deadlines.
